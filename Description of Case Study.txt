******************** DESCRIPTION OF CASE STUDY ********************
At Mobicom, you are a business analyst and have been urgently called into a meeting with the marketing head and retention manager. 
The agenda of this meeting is to discuss the results of Industry survey reports that have been just released. 
In response to these reports, senior management at Mobicom is concerned that the market environment of rising churn rates and declining ARPU will hit them even harder as churn rate at Mobicom is relatively high. 
Currently they have been focussing on retaining their customers on a reactive basis when the subscriber calls in to close the account. 
But this alone does not seem to be enough and the management team is keen to take more initiatives on this front. 
One of these is to roll out targeted proactive retention programs,which include usage enhancing marketing programs to increase minutes of usage (MOU), rate plan migration, and a bundling strategy among others.  
To be able to effectively drive these retention strategies,a few key questions of interest require urgent attention and you been given the task of showcasing data based insights and recommendations relating to subscriber churn.

######### Top Line Questions of Interest to Senior Management #########:
1.What are the top five factors driving likelihood of churn at Mobicom?
2.Validation of survey findings. 
a) Whether "cost and billing" and "network and service quality" are important factors influencing churn behaviour. 
b) Are data usage connectivity issues turning out to be costly? In other words, is it leading to churn?
3.Would you recommend rate plan migration as a proactive retention strategy?
4.What would be your recommendation on how to use this churn model for prioritisation of customers for a proactive retention campaigns in the future? 
5.What would be the target segments for proactive retention campaigns? Falling ARPU forecast is also a concern and therefore, Mobicom would like to save their high revenue customers besides managing churn. Given a budget constraint of a contact list of 20% of the subscriber pool, which subscribers should prioritized if "revenue saves" is also a priority besides controlling churn. In other words, controlling churn is the primary objective and revenue saves is the secondary objective.
